## 🧪 Getting Started

### 📋 Prerequisites

- Python `3.8+`  
- MySQL (MySQL Workbench is useful too)

---

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-monitoring-app.git
cd stock-monitoring-app
```

### 2. Set up MySQL Database:

- Create a MySQL database and user for the app.


### 3. Run Database Migrations:

- The app uses SQLAlchemy for ORM-based database management. Run migrations to create tables in MySQL.

- You can manually create the database or let the app create it on startup.


### 4. Start the Application:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

or (use any convenient port)
```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080
```


### 5. Testing the API:

- This will start the FastAPI application locally. Open the browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000 to access the API.

- Visiting http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs will open the testing environment for FastAPI backend (no Postman here)


## Future Enhancements

- Front-End Dashboard: A React-based front-end for visualizing stocks and their performance.

- More Complex AI/ML Models: Integration of advanced stock prediction or anomaly detection models.

- Notification Services: Expand alerting systems to include email, SMS, or push notifications.

- Performance Optimization: Investigate database partitioning and indexing strategies to improve query performance with large datasets.
